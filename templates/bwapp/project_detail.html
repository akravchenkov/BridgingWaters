    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
    <p>Social centers and water conservation is a positive contribution to the village.</p>
    <strong>Successes:</strong> A pool was created where laundry could be done.  For an area that depends on rainwater collection, this helps to conserve water.  Also, it provided a central location for children to play during the heat of the day.<br/>
    <strong>Obstacles:</strong> The most difficult part was getting the project going.  It was also difficult to express the need for this pool to outside groups.<br/>
    <strong>Community Impact:</strong> The women of the village spend time socially doing laundry and bathing.  The children enjoy this pool and can be supervised by adults.<br/>
    <strong>Pre-Construction Actions Required by the Community:</strong> The need from the program was discovered by interviewing citizens of the village.  The results of this were then submitted to the village counsel.<br/>
